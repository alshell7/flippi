  "body": "# __Flippi__\r\n*A simple android app to style the text (flip it basically).*\r\n\r\nAlways wondered how would it be possible to flip the text, when it would still remain the same when you flip your phone and type anything!:wink:. There were many other such apps in the Google Play Store too that could just do it. **Flippi** is just a cool app for text styling. After bit of googling up, since android smoothly supports _Unicode_, found that it were those present in its _Character Table_ [(Check it out here)] (http://unicode-table.com/en/#control-character). The characters are replaced with the respective upside down equivalent unicode character.\r\n\r\nSomething like,\r\n>â„² U+2132 TURNED CAPITAL F\r\n\r\nThats it, this app just a piece for demonstrating it, how it really happens to have the text flipped (styled). Those upside down equivalent of the real unicode characters are collected and have been hardcoded inside the resources.\r\n\r\n## *Features*\r\n* Includes four different styles. (one that simply reverses :wink:)\r\n* Flip the text without going to the app (_Flippi Float_)\r\n  * Directly share the flipped text to any other app, or\r\n  * Copy it to the Clipboard.\r\n  \r\n## *License Agreement*\r\n\r\nREAD CAREFULLY ALL TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT BEFORE USING\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE\r\nAGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THIS SOFTWARE\r\nPermission is hereby granted to anyone to freely use `Flippi`\r\nfor any purpose with the exception of including it in a\r\nproduct, in which case both permission and acknowledgment are\r\nrequired.\r\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the software\r\nand documentation are provided \"as is\". alshell\r\n(hereafter referred to as 'the author') disclaim all other\r\nwarranties and conditions, either express or implied, including,\r\nbut not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness\r\nfor a particular purpose, conformance with description, title and\r\nnon-infringement of third party rights.
