</h1>

<p><em>A simple android app to style the text (flip it basically).</em></p>

<p>Always wondered how would it be possible to flip the text, when it would still remain the same when you flip your phone and type anything!<g-emoji alias="wink" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" ios-version="6.0">ðŸ˜‰</g-emoji>. There were many other such apps in the Google Play Store too that could just do it. <strong>Flippi</strong> is just a cool app for text styling. After bit of googling up, since android smoothly supports <em>Unicode</em>, found that it were those present in its <em>Character Table</em> <a href="http://unicode-table.com/en/#control-character">(Check it out here)</a>. The characters are replaced with the respective upside down equivalent unicode character.</p>

<p>Something like,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>â„² U+2132 TURNED CAPITAL F</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats it, this app just a piece for demonstrating it, how it really happens to have the text flipped (styled). Those upside down equivalent of the real unicode characters are collected and have been hardcoded inside the resources.</p>

<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><em>Features</em>
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Includes four different styles. (one that simply reverses <g-emoji alias="wink" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" ios-version="6.0">ðŸ˜‰</g-emoji>)</li>
<li>Flip the text without going to the app (<em>Flippi Float</em>)

<ul>
<li>Directly share the flipped text to any other app, or</li>
<li>Copy it to the Clipboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
